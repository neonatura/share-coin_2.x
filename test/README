The sources in this directory are unit test cases.  Boost includes a
unit testing framework, and since bitcoin already uses boost, it makes
sense to simply use this framework rather than require developers to
configure some other framework (we want as few impediments to creating
unit tests as possible).


Requires installing the libboost "test" development package:

(ubuntu)
apt-get install libboost-test-dev

(centos)
yum install boost-test
