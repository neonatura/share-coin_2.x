The c++ boost shared library is required. To be specific, the "system", "filesystem", "program_options", and "thread" boost libraries. The "shcoind" and "shcoin" programs are the only sharelib program that link against boost libraries. To install on linux run 'yum install libboost*' or 'apt-get install libboost*'.

The 'openssl version 1.0.1g' distribution has been included. This version will automatically be compiled and linked against the shcoind and shcoin programs.
